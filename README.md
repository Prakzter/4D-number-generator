## 'Hmmm...wah so long que ah? Ya la it's 4 million draw lei' ##

If there's one thing that all Singaporeans (specifically those from the baby boomer generations) love to do, it's to try their luck at 4D. Where the realms of probability and superstitions converge, these folks love to punt away week after week.

Here are some interesting facts about this elusive 'past-time':
- Every number has a 23 in 10,000 odds of winning.
- For every $1 bet placed on 4D Ordinary (Big), you are reducing that net worth down to $0.659.
- For every $1 bet placed on 4D Ordinary (Small), you are reducing that net worth down to $0.697.
- This does not change even if you are betting on Systems and 4D Roll.
- You are on a lower net worth when you bet on iBet.
